Python version 3.6+

What Is This?
-------------
This is a service you can build to visually see what things you want to be monitoring on a website. Currently, it is set up to monitor newly added items or in-stock items that were previously out-of-stock. Minor changes will need to be made to fix it up and make it actually pull from sites like you see in the GIF.
